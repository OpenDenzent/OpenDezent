Inspiration
In this data-driven world, the main concern has been people’s privacy. Almost every application asks for user details and there is always an "I accept the terms and conditions agreement" with the application company. We are bound to sign the application and give the company the right to use our data. However decentralized technologies and the emerging Zero Knowledge research are ushering in an era where this dependency can be eliminated and the authenticity of a user can be verified without actually revealing any of the user data.

“Unifying through Decentralization” and “Complete Anonymity” has been the biggest boon of Web3 and one of the most significant limitations of Web2 applications. Taking this into account we were motivated to build a zero-knowledge blogging platform for anonymous blogging. One of the most substantial use cases of such a platform is for journalists giving them complete freedom to write articles/share their views without being prone to any threats

What it does
ZK-Writers is a zero-knowledge based anonymous blogging platform which uses semaphores. Semaphore is a protocol, designed to be a simple and generic privacy layer for Ethereum DApps. Using zero-knowledge, Ethereum users can prove their membership in a group and send signals without revealing their original identity. Additionally, we have used relayers to conceal and fortify the transaction and thus provide complete anonymity.

Here is the system diagram describing the workflow of the application

Challenges you ran into
Integrating zero-knowledge
Adding Transaction relayers
Handling semaphore logic
Anything else?
While the app is a functional proof of concept of an anonymous blogging site, it might be limited in features at this stage. Some of the future prospects are -
Add comments functionality
An option for the user to link his previous blogs (by verifying the authorship of an article anonymously)
